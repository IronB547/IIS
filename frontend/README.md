## TODO
- If the ticket is closed (2,3) grey out commenting [same with requests]
- Make comments ordered by date
- Hide the text "Komentáře" when no comments are present (or add a text that says "Žádné komentáře")
- Some prettier/more intelligent way to return back to tickets, you have to click tickets over and over and over
- Status can be over 3 without any errors
- Change the Secondary button into a dropdown/two buttons for edit and delete, this one seems to make the scrolling of the site weird

## DONE
- Convert everything from English to Czech (location, description, comments...), remove the ticket detail: and request detail:
- fix storing user info with reactiveness
- First screen should be login screen/ticket screen and hide logout
- Users are just ID numbers
- Pretty much every button on every view is different color
